## RL agent train to discriminate PCG for GAN

In [Previous project](../DDQN-PG-PPO-with-Mario/), one has tried to train RL agent to Mario environment. To classify which algorithm is outperform. In this project, one try more to generating level environment by Procedural Content Generation (PCG) with GAN.
